My name is Chayanont Piyawatcharavijit, and I’m currently a master’s student at Monash University studying Business Analytics. I’m really passionate about data and how it can be used to solve real-world problems. I have a background in computer engineering, which has given me a solid mix of technical and analytical skills. Right now, I’m focused on learning how to use analytics and machine learning to make better decisions and find insights that can make a difference in business.
