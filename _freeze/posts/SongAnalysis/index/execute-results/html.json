[@childs-youngIFPIGlobalStudy2023]. This come to this question have you ever wondered what makes couple of songs like Radioactive by Imagine Dragons, stay on the billboard for so long? In this analysis, we dive deeply into the trend of Billboard's top 100 songs over the past decade, exploring key audio features like energy and acousticness. \n\n# Data description\n\nBefore dig into an analysis, let's talk about data sources that we will be using. There are two data sources for this analysis report both retrieved by [\\@TidytuesdayData2021](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-09-14/readme.md) \n\n1.    **Billboard's top 100 chart songs**: A standard record chart in the US for songs by weekly Billboard magazine including metric on the chart, we will mainly use this to determine weekly track position.\n\n2.    **Spotify data**: one of the most popular music streaming services, including each detail of the tracks, especially audio features which are the main metric for our analysis! \n\nFor detailed data dictionary for both data sources are provided in the [data dictionary](#sec-appendix)\n\n# Changing Trends in Audio Features on the Billboard Charts Throughout the 2010s: An analysis\n\nThis chart from @fig-audio-feat demonstrates track features as measured by Spotify, one of the most popular music streaming service. Look at the billboard data from the 2010s, most features are pretty much the same through out the decade. However, four of them saw some significantly changes over the last decades. Acousticness, speechiness, and danceability were the three biggest winners, while energy features faced their biggest downside. These trend shift reflects how listeners' preferences have changed over time. \n\nAlthough taste in music is a subjective things and hard to generalize, many people use music to get moving which could explain the rise in danceability [@MusicEmotionWellBeing]. Despite a small drop in valence (measuring the the positivity of the track), emotional response can still be influenced by it, especially when it reaches to arousal levels [@hofbauerEmotionalValencePerception2023a].\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Mean of Audio Features Over Time](index_files/figure-html/fig-audio-feat-1.png){#fig-audio-feat fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\nAnother interesting aspect is the relationship between tracks that were able to stayed on the charts for a long time and other songs. By looking at the top 5 longest-running tracks in the 2010s in @tbl-top5, these songs managed to stayed on the billboard for more than a year (52 weeks). For example, \"Radioactive\" by Imagine Dragons and \"Sail\" by AWOLNATION. The interesting thing is these top hit seems to have their similarity. They all have high energy (0.784 for \"Radioactive\") and are pretty danceable (0.825 for \"Sail\"). Another common feature is their low acousticness, meaning they are more focused on music. This might help explain why they held onto their spots for so long.\n\n\n::: {#tbl-top5 .cell layout-align=\"center\" tbl-cap='Top 5 longest tracks on the Billboard'}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table table-striped table-hover table-condensed table-responsive\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> Song </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;font-weight: bold;\"> Performer </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;\"> acousticness </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;\"> danceability </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;\"> speechiness </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;\"> energy </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;font-weight: bold;\"> Weeks on chart </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3cm; \"> Radioactive </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3cm; \"> Imagine Dragons </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.1060 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.448 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0627 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.784 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 87 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3cm; \"> Sail </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3cm; \"> AWOLNATION </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.4520 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.825 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0568 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.435 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 79 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3cm; \"> Counting Stars </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3cm; \"> OneRepublic </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0654 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.664 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0382 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.705 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 68 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3cm; \"> Party Rock Anthem </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3cm; \"> LMFAO Featuring Lauren Bennett &amp; GoonRock </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0189 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.750 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.1420 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.727 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 68 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3cm; \"> Rolling In The Deep </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;width: 3cm; \"> Adele </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.1310 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.729 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0294 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.756 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 65 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nLooking at the bigger picture from @tbl-top5, @fig-dist shows that long-lasting hits tend to have lower acousticness and higher energy, which aligns with what we have found earlier like \"Radioactive\". While danceability and speechiness don't seems to vary much between short and long lasting tracks, suggesting that they might not played a big role in terms of song’s chart duration. Instead, songs with more energy and a less acoustic tend to maintain on the chart longer. This highlights just how important these sound elements for long-term success.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![Distribution of Audio Features by Chart Duration](index_files/figure-html/fig-dist-1.png){#fig-dist fig-align='center' width=80%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n\n\n# Conclusion\n\nTo conclude, we analyzed Billboard’s top 100 songs over the past decade and found that long-lasting hits, like \"Radioactive\" and \"Sail,\" share key similar audio features such as higher energy and lower acousticness. To be more specific, the more energetic and less acoustic a song is, the more likely it is to stay popular. While danceability and speechiness don’t seem to make a big difference, energy and acousticness are like the secret sauce to a song’s longevity on the charts.\n\n\n# Appendix\n\n## Data dictionary {#sec-appendix}\n\n**billboard dataset**\n\n| variable       | variable | description                                                       |\n|-------------|-------------|---------------------------------------------|\n| week_id        | string   | Direct identifier of the week of the Billboard.                   |\n| song           | string   | Song name                                                         |\n| performer      | string   | Performer name                                                    |\n| song_id        | string   | Direct identifier of the song, concatenate of song and performer. |\n| weeks_on_chart | double   | Iteration of the week on the chart.                               |\n\n**audio_features dataset (For fourth to the ninth variable are an indicator ranging from 0.0 - 1.0)**\n\n| variable                 | variable | description                                                                                                 |\n|-------------|-------------|-----------------------------------------------|\n| song_id                  | string   | Direct identifier of the song, concatenate of song and performer.                                           |\n| song                     | string   | Song name                                                                                                   |\n| spotify_genre            | string   | Genre of the song by Spotify                                                                                |\n| danceability             | double   | Describe how danceable the tracks are based on a combination of the various musical elements.               |\n| energy                   | double   | Describe a measure of intensity and activity of the tracks based on perceptual features.                    |\n| speechiness              | double   | Describe the occurrence of spoken words.                                                                    |\n| acousticness             | double   | Describe the acousticness of the track.                                                                     |\n| instrumentalness         | double   | Describe the instrumentalness of the track.
