# Uncovering the secret ingreidents behind those chart-toppers: a decade of music trends

People around the world loves music as they are enjoying to their favorite tracks 20.7 minutes each week on average which is almost a day! [@childs-youngIFPIGlobalStudy2023]. This come to this question have you ever wondered what makes couple of songs like Radioactive by Imagine Dragons, stay on the billboard for so long? In this analysis, we dive deeply into the trend of Billboard's top 100 songs over the past decade, exploring key audio features like energy and acousticness. 

# Data description

Before dig into an analysis, let's talk about data sources that we will be using. There are two data sources for this analysis report both retrieved by [\@TidytuesdayData2021](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-09-14/readme.md) 

1.    **Billboard's top 100 chart songs**: A standard record chart in the US for songs by weekly Billboard magazine including metric on the chart, we will mainly use this to determine weekly track position.

2.    **Spotify data**: one of the most popular music streaming services, including each detail of the tracks, especially audio features which are the main metric for our analysis! 

For detailed data dictionary for both data sources are provided in the [data dictionary](#sec-appendix)

# Changing Trends in Audio Features on the Billboard Charts Throughout the 2010s: An analysis

This chart from @fig-audio-feat demonstrates track features measured by Spotify, one of the most popular music streaming services. Look at the billboard data from the 2010s, most features are pretty much the same throughout the decade. However, four of them saw some significant changes over the last decades. Acousticness, speechiness, and danceability were the three biggest winners, while energy features faced their biggest downside. This trend shift reflects how listeners' preferences have changed over time. 

Although taste in music is a subjective thing and hard to generalize, many people use music to get moving which could explain the rise in danceability [@MusicEmotionWellBeing]. Despite a small drop in valence (measuring the positivity of the track), the emotional response can still be influenced by it, especially when it reaches arousal levels [@hofbauerEmotionalValencePerception2023a].

```{r}
#| label: fig-audio-feat
#| fig-cap: "Mean of Audio Features Over Time"
feature_long <- billboard %>% 
  left_join(audio_features, by = "song_id") %>% 
  pivot_longer(cols = c(danceability:valence),
               names_to = "features", 
               values_to = "value")

feature_trend <- feature_long %>% 
  filter(year %in% c(2010:2019)) %>%
  filter(!features %in% c("key", "loudness","mode")) %>% 
  group_by(year, features) %>% 
  summarize(mean_val = mean(value, na.rm = TRUE)) 

ggplot(feature_trend, aes(x = year, y = mean_val, color = features)) + 
  geom_line() + 
  geom_text(data = feature_trend %>% filter(year == 2019), 
            aes(label = paste0(round(mean_val, 2), " ", features)), 
            hjust = -0.1, 
            vjust = 0.3) + 
  geom_text(data = feature_trend %>% filter(year == 2010), 
              aes(label = round(mean_val, 2)), 
              vjust = 0.4,
              hjust = 1) + 
  labs(
    x = "Year",
    y = "Mean Value"
  ) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = c(2010, 2013, 2016, 2019), expand = c(0.5, 1.0)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

```

Another interesting aspect is the relationship between tracks that could stay on the charts for a long time and other songs. By looking at the top 5 longest-running tracks in the 2010s in @tbl-top5, these songs stayed on the billboard for more than a year (52 weeks). For example, "Radioactive" by Imagine Dragons and "Sail" by AWOLNATION. The interesting thing is this top hit seems to have their similarity. They all have high energy (0.784 for "Radioactive") and are pretty danceable (0.825 for "Sail"). Another common feature is their low acousticness, meaning they are more focused on music. This might help explain why they held onto their spots for so long.

```{r}
#| label: tbl-top5
#| tbl-cap: "Top 5 longest tracks on the Billboard"
billboard %>% 
  filter(year %in% 2010:2019) %>%
  left_join(audio_features, by = "song_id") %>% 
  group_by(song.x, performer.x, acousticness, danceability, speechiness, energy) %>% 
  summarize(weeks_on_chart = max(weeks_on_chart)) %>%
  arrange(-weeks_on_chart) %>% 
  rename("Song" = song.x,
         "Performer" = performer.x,
         "Weeks on chart" = weeks_on_chart) %>%
  head(5) %>%
  kable() %>%
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = c("striped", 
                                      "hover", 
                                      "condensed", 
                                      "responsive"),
                full_width = F) %>%
  column_spec(1:2, width = "3cm") %>%  
  row_spec(0, bold = TRUE) %>% 
  row_spec(1:4,hline_after = TRUE)
```

Looking at the bigger picture from @tbl-top5, @fig-dist shows that long-lasting hits tend to have lower acoustics and higher energy, which aligns with what we have found earlier like "Radioactive". Danceability and speechiness don't seem to vary much between short and long-lasting tracks, suggesting that they might not played a big role in terms of the song’s chart duration. Instead, songs with more energy and less acoustic tend to remain on the chart longer. This highlights just how important these sound elements are for long-term success.

```{r}
#| label: fig-dist
#| fig-cap: "Distribution of Audio Features by Chart Duration"

tracks_with_genre <- audio_features %>%
  left_join(billboard, by = "song_id") %>% 
  #filter(year %in% c(2010:2019)) %>%
  mutate(extracted_genre = str_extract_all(spotify_genre, "'([^']*)'")) %>%
  unnest(extracted_genre) %>%
  mutate(extracted_genre = gsub("'", "", extracted_genre))

tracks_with_genre <- tracks_with_genre %>%
  group_by(song_id) %>%
  mutate(weeks_on_chart_max = max(weeks_on_chart),
         is_more_than_52 = if_else(weeks_on_chart_max >= 52, "More than or equal 52 weeks", "Less than 52 weeks")) %>%
  ungroup()

tracks_features_long <- tracks_with_genre %>%
  select(song_id, is_more_than_52, energy, acousticness, danceability, speechiness) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(energy, acousticness, danceability, speechiness),
               names_to = "feature",
               values_to = "value") %>% 
    na.omit() 

ggplot(tracks_features_long, aes(x = is_more_than_52, 
                                 y = value, 
                                 fill = fct_reorder(feature,value))) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  facet_grid(~feature) +
  labs(x = "Audio Feature",
       y = "Value",
       fill = "More Than 52 Weeks") +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1),
        legend.position = "none") 
  
```



# Conclusion

To conclude, we analyzed Billboard’s top 100 songs over the past decade and found that long-lasting hits, like "Radioactive" and "Sail," share key similar audio features such as higher energy and lower acousticness. To be more specific, the more energetic and less acoustic a song is, the more likely it is to stay popular. While danceability and speechiness don’t seem to make a big difference, energy and acousticness are like the secret sauce to a song’s longevity on the charts.
